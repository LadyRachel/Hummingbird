#2-10-2025: Checked the genome browser for AEP and see that some of the sequences are not annotated as "long" as they blast to. Means I have to pull them out of the Olig Database from the 
portal. Continued with the process of clearing out the duplicated or missing opsins in the list generated by Blast. Because we are looking at comparisons from originally 105, the movement to AEP means there could be some duplications, retrotranspositions, or false positives (?).

#I wonder what the difference is
