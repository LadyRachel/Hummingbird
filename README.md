#Do i want to test for selection for amino acids--are there spots being conserved or
ask Maya for pass for Itol


#3-4-25: In IQ tree need to delete H vulgaris sequences
grep "hydra"
keep hydractinia but get rid of the hydra opsins

in excel tab delineated extracts the sequences from AEP and olig
put into word 
make into a fasta
cat the filtered file from kyle with the AEP

name something final_opsins_list.fasta

#3-3-25: 
PREDICTED: Hydra vulgaris opsin-3 (LOC105847721), mRNA

HOLI01635.G27067-> kept from Kevins check

#2-27-25: reverse complement for mega alignment along with one and two spoaces at a time to fgind best on ewith no stop asterisk
#2-11-2025: 

#2-10-2025: Checked the genome browser for AEP and see that some of the sequences are not annotated as "long" as they blast to. Means I have to pull them out of the Olig Database from the 
portal. Continued with the process of clearing out the duplicated or missing opsins in the list generated by Blast. Because we are looking at comparisons from originally 105, the movement to AEP means there could be some duplications, retrotranspositions, or false positives (?).

#I wonder what the difference is
